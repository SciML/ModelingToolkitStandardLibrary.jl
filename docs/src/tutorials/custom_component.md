# Custom Component

In this tutorial, the creation of a custom component is demonstrated via the [Chua's circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chua%27s_circuit).
The circuit is a simple circuit that shows chaotic behavior.
Except for a non-linear resistor, every other component already is part of `ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary.Electrical`.

First, we need to make some imports.

```@example components
using ModelingToolkit
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t
using ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary.Electrical
using ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary.Electrical: OnePort
using OrdinaryDiffEq
using IfElse: ifelse
using Plots
```

## Custom Component

Now the custom component can be defined.
The [Modelica implementation](https://www.maplesoft.com/documentation_center/online_manuals/modelica/Modelica_Electrical_Analog_Examples_Utilities.html#Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Examples.Utilities.NonlinearResistor) of the `NonlinearResistor` looks as follows:

```Modelica
model NonlinearResistor "Chua's resistor"
  extends Interfaces.OnePort;

  parameter SI.Conductance Ga "conductance in inner voltage range";
  parameter SI.Conductance Gb "conductance in outer voltage range";
  parameter SI.Voltage Ve "inner voltage range limit";
equation
  i = if (v < -Ve) then Gb*(v + Ve) - Ga*Ve else if (v > Ve) then Gb*(v - Ve) + Ga*Ve else Ga*v;
end NonlinearResistor;
```

this can almost be directly translated to the syntax of `ModelingToolkit`.

```@example components
function NonlinearResistor(; name, Ga, Gb, Ve)
    @named oneport = OnePort()
    @unpack v, i = oneport
    pars = @parameters Ga=Ga Gb=Gb Ve=Ve
    eqs = [
        i ~ ifelse(v < -Ve,
        Gb * (v + Ve) - Ga * Ve,
        ifelse(v > Ve,
            Gb * (v - Ve) + Ga * Ve,
            Ga * v))
    ]
    extend(ODESystem(eqs, t, [], pars; name = name), oneport)
end
nothing # hide
```

### Explanation

All components in `ModelingToolkit` are created via a function that serves as the constructor and returns some form of system, in this case, an `ODESystem`.
Since the non-linear resistor is essentially a standard electrical component with two ports, we can extend from the `OnePort` component of the library.

```julia
@named oneport = OnePort()
```

This creates a `OnePort` with the `name = :oneport`.
For easier notation, we can unpack the states of the component

```julia
@unpack v, i = oneport
```

It might be a good idea to create parameters for the constants of the `NonlinearResistor`.

```julia
pars = @parameters Ga=Ga Gb=Gb Ve=Ve
```

The syntax looks funny but it simply creates symbolic parameters with the name `Ga` where its default value is set from the function's argument `Ga`.
While this is not strictly necessary it allows the user to `remake` the problem easily with different parameters or allow for auto-tuning or parameter optimization without having to do all the costly steps that may be involved with building and simplifying a model.
The non-linear (in this case piece-wise constant) equation for the current can be implemented using `IfElse.ifelse`.
Finally, the created `oneport` component is extended with the created equations and parameters.
In this case, no extra state variables are added, hence an empty vector is supplied.
The independent variable `t` needs to be supplied as the second argument.

```julia
extend(ODESystem(eqs, t, [], pars; name = name), oneport)
```

## Building the Model

The final model can now be created with the components from the library and the new custom component.

```@example components
@named L = Inductor(L = 18)
@named Ro = Resistor(R = 12.5e-3)
@named G = Conductor(G = 0.565)
@named C1 = Capacitor(C = 10, v = 4)
@named C2 = Capacitor(C = 100)
@named Nr = NonlinearResistor(Ga = -0.757576,
    Gb = -0.409091,
    Ve = 1)
@named Gnd = Ground()

connections = [connect(L.p, G.p)
               connect(G.n, Nr.p)
               connect(Nr.n, Gnd.g)
               connect(C1.p, G.n)
               connect(L.n, Ro.p)
               connect(G.p, C2.p)
               connect(C1.n, Gnd.g)
               connect(C2.n, Gnd.g)
               connect(Ro.n, Gnd.g)]

@named model = ODESystem(connections, t, systems = [L, Ro, G, C1, C2, Nr, Gnd])
nothing # hide
```

## Simulating the Model

Now the model can be simulated.
First, `structural_simplify` is called on the model and an `ODEProblem` is built from the result.
Since the initial voltage of the first capacitor was already specified via `v`, no initial condition is given and an empty pair is supplied.

```@example components
sys = structural_simplify(model)
prob = ODEProblem(sys, Pair[], (0, 5e4), saveat = 0.01)
sol = solve(prob, Rodas4())

Plots.plot(sol[C1.v], sol[C2.v], title = "Chaotic Attractor", label = "",
    ylabel = "C1 Voltage in V", xlabel = "C2 Voltage in V")
Plots.savefig("chua_phase_plane.png")
nothing # hide

Plots.plot(sol; idxs = [C1.v, C2.v, L.i],
    labels = ["C1 Voltage in V" "C2 Voltage in V" "Inductor Current in A"])
Plots.savefig("chua.png")
nothing # hide
```
