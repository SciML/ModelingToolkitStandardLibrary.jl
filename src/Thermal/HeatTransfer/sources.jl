    FixedHeatFlow(; name, Q_flow=1.0, T_ref=293.15, alpha=0.0)

Fixed heat flow boundary condition.

This model allows a specified amount of heat flow rate to be "injected" into a thermal system at a given port.
The constant amount of heat flow rate `Q_flow` is given as a parameter. The heat flows into the component to which
the component FixedHeatFlow is connected, if parameter `Q_flow` is positive.

- `port`

# Parameters:
- `Q_flow`: [W] Fixed heat flow rate at port
- `T_ref`: [K] Reference temperature
- `alpha`: [1/K] Temperature coefficient of heat flow rate

Fixed temperature boundary condition in kelvin.

    PrescribedHeatFlow(; name, Q_flow=1.0, T_ref=293.15, alpha=0.0)

Prescribed heat flow boundary condition.

This model allows a specified amount of heat flow rate to be "injected" into a thermal system at a given port. 
The amount of heat is given by the input signal `Q_flow` into the model. The heat flows into the component to which 
the component `PrescribedHeatFlow` is connected, if the input signal is positive.
If parameter alpha is > 0, the heat flow is multiplied by `1 + alpha*(port.T - T_ref`) in order to simulate temperature 
dependent losses (which are given an reference temperature T_ref).

- `port`
